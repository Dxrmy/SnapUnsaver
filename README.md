**SnapUnsaver** is a high-speed automation utility designed for mass data management and personal privacy. While it currently specializes in unsaving Snapchat media via ADB, it is evolving into a universal redaction suite.

## The Roadmap
- 👻 **Snapchat Automation**: ADB-driven unsaving and media archiving.
- 🤖 **Discord Cleanup**: (Planned) Mass deletion of private messages and channel history.
- 🌐 **Reddit Deep-Purge**: (Planned) Universal redaction of posts and comments.
- ⚡ **Cross-Platform Vision**: Uses OpenCV for unified UI detection across any app.
